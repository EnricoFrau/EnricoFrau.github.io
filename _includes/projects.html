    <h3> Master's Thesis </h3>
    <p>How do learning machines develop abstraction? This project used statistical physics to show that truly abstract representations emerge only when depth and data breadth combine—depth creates structure, breadth drives universality. Working with <a href="https://www.ictp.it/member/matteo-marsili#biography" target="_blank">Prof. Matteo Marsili</a>'s group at <a href="https://www.ictp.it/" target="_blank">ICTP</a>, I developed experiments showing Autoencoders converge toward universal distributions (Hierarchical Feature Model) as training data becomes more diverse. The work treats "abstraction" as measurable through information theory, bridging physics, AI, and cognitive science.</p>

    <h3> Computational Physics Course Project</h3>
    <p>Simulation of magnetic phase transitions in 2D spin lattices using cellular automata. The computational core is written in Fortran for performance—handling thousands of lattice evolution steps—while Python manages the analysis and visualization layer.
I selected this project to highlight the capability to understand when to use low-level languages for heavy computation and how to integrate them effectively with higher-level tools. It also demonstrates numerical methods for studying critical phenomena in statistical mechanics.</p>
